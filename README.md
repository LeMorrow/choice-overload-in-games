This repository is a final year game design student project regarding choice overload in games.<br />
The game is made in Unity 2018.2.7f1 and the results of the study can be found [here](Results).

## Abstract
There is a general notion that having many options is favorable for a decision maker. This notion has been both proven and disproven by numerous studies, and no consensus exists on the effects of the cognitive process called choice overload. Most research on the topic revolve around supermarkets and other economies. To expand the knowledge about choice overload, the purpose of this study is to identify whether the effects of choice overload exists in video games. More specifically, if a correlation can be seen between the amount of choices and a game's entertainment value. To analyze this, a computer game was made and played by 34 subjects. The subjects were assigned one of six game modes in the game, all with different amount of choices in the character creation menu. After creating their character, the subjects answered questions that were presented within the game. When the game had been played, the subjects evaluated the game's entertainment value by answering more questions. The results of this study could not show any correlation between the amount of choices and the entertainment value of the game.
